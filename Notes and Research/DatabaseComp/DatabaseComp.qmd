### Design Element 2: Search Bar or Non-Search

We can implement a search bar landing screen such as this:

![search bar](images/search_bar.png)

* This is the _most common_ landing page type between all the databases. 
* This is also the most **simple** implementation.
* Will include **tabs** to click to other useful pages present, like so:
