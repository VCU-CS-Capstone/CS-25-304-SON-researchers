# Landing Page

## Design Element 1: Minimal or Maximal

General preference leaning towards a minimal design?

Such as this:

![minimal design](images/minimal.png)

* Simpler, less-cluttered design
* Has less information from the start

Or a more information-filled, and maximal design?

Such as this:

![maximal design](images/maximalist.png)

* More complex, busy design
* User has more information from the start

## Design Element 2: Search Bar or Non-Search

We can implement a search bar landing screen such as this:

![search bar](images/search_bar.png)

* Greeted with search bar, inviting user to jump right into the data
* This is the _most common_ landing page type between all the databases. 
* This is also the most **simple** implementation.
* Will include **tabs** to click to other useful pages present, like so:

Or we can implement a non-search bar landing screen, which may include many different types:

* **Type 1:** Interesting infographics, data visuals:
