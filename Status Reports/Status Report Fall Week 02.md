## 1) Accomplishments this week ##
   - Had a meeting with Dr. Leonard to get a framework of our project and what to start putting focus towards in the upcoming weeks.
   - Assigned project roles to each member so we can specialize our abilities.
   - Reached out to our sponsor, Dr. Lana Sargent, in order to have a meeting set up ASAP.
   - Submitted the first major deliverable, the Team Contract.

## 2) Milestones to be completed next week ##
   - Have a meeting with our sponsor to get a sense of what needs to be accomplished and get a better understanding of the databases, programs, etc. we will be using to do this project.
   - Look over an dpossibly start the next major deliverable, the Project Proposal. This deliverable will definitely take some time to complete, so starting early is the best solution.

## 3) Issues, problems or concerns ##
   - No real issues to report, only real concern I have is the allocation of time we as members are going to have going forward. We are still in the early stages of this project and there is not much real work to be done at the moment. However, once the workload starts to ramp up as we go further in the semester, it is of utmost importance that each of us take the time to preemptively approach upcoming assignments, rather than take the "firefighting" approach. We are doing a fine job already with this though so I have no doubt we will do our best :]
