## 1) Accomplishments this week ##
   - Submitted the next project deliverable, the GitHub repository setup.
   - William started work on learning the REDCap database we will be using for this project.
   - Alex created a very nice mockup poster for our group, and will definitely server as a good basis for when we need to have it done (November deadline).

## 2) Milestones to be completed next week ##
   - Interpret our meeting with our sponsor and start conceptualizing our project with this information.
   - Set up another meeting with our faculty sponsor to get more guidancea and see if our interpretations of the sponsor's wants align with our vision of the project.

## 3) Issues, problems or concerns ##
   - No issues so far, I (William) am a bit stressed with the task of having to learn the database we are going to use for this project. I've never really worked with databases outside of academically, so it will be quite the challenge to figure out how to apply my newfound knowledge into a real-world application.
