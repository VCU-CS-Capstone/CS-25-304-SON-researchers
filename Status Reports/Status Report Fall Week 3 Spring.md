**Mentor: Dr. Lana Sargent (lsargent@vcu.edu)**

**Faculty Advisor: Dr. John Leonard (jdleonard@vcu.edu)**

## 1) Accomplishments this week ##
   - Alex has come up with a continuation of our Figma prototype page, and has added a filter page to the original layout. We are thinking of scrapping the idea of a keyword search bar in favor of a more streamlined filter system, since that works out of the box with the new API.

## 2) Milestones to be completed next week ##
  - Continue work on Figma prototype, start to develop a 'Results' page that will dish out information for researchers based on the selected filters.

## 3) Issues, problems or concerns ##
   - One of the group members of another team has created dynamic graphs based on the data from the API database, and we have no idea how they implemented it. We want to have something similar, so we're asking them for help in that regard.
