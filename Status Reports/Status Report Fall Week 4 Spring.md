## 1) Accomplishments this week ##
   - Our meeting this week consisted of learning more about the API system and the calls it makes, learning that we do not have to develop anything in a specific language or framework, the API is really independent.

## 2) Milestones to be completed next week ##
  - Have another meeting sometime with our project sponsors, as we have not had a meeting with them for a while, and see if they ever received the feedback form we sent out to them before the end of last semester.

## 3) Issues, problems or concerns ##
   - No issues for now.
