## Fall Semester

| Document | Tasks | Accomplishments | Issues |
|---|---|---|---|
| Week 1 Status Report | Introductions, setting up Discord server | We met as a team for the first time and introduced ourselves as students: What major we are, and what year we are in. Haley set up a Discord server for us to ahve an open communication line and to share any resources we need easily. | No problems to report! |
| Week 2 Status Report | Have our first meeting with our faculty sponsor, Dr. John Leonard | We as a team gained valuable information regarding the direction of our focus after the meeting with Dr. Leonard. The GitHub was also cleaned up a little bit, and the README was updated to be in-lin with our next deliverable requirements. | No issues to report, smooth sailing for now. |
| Week 3 Status Report | Have a meeting with our sponsor, Dr. Lana Sargent, submit next project deliverable | Status reports were created in the project's GitHub, and the GitHub repo setup assignment was turned in successfully. | No issues to report! |
| Week 4 Status Report |  Met with Dr. Leonard and received some helpful information regarding some example databases we can show off to project sponsors for feedback. Met with the sponsors who informed us to become familiar with REDCAP, the database we will be using for the actual medical data. | Prepared a timeline of events in relation to due dates / project proposal. | No issues to report.
| Week 5 Status Report | Met together as a team to talk more about how we want to tackle the Project Proposal, as the deadline is rapidly approaching. Start prototyping with Figma to make a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) to use in future presentations. | No major accomplishments this week, continueing piecework on Project Proposal | No issues to report.
| Week 6 Status Report | Have another meeting with sponsors to get clarification on data elements and initial learning on REDCap database with other Capstone teams. | After having another meeting with Dr. Leonard who told us to gather examples of other databases to show to sponsors, we created a Database Compilation document that showcases various examples of landing pages. | Our initial meeting with iCubed researchers on Nov. 19th was canceled, so we will have to find another way to present our research outside of a meeting with them.
| Week 7 Status Report | Submit Team Contract through Canvas by end of the week and start focusing more on the Figma prototype. | Had our weekly team meeting where we all came together to work on the first threee sections of the Team Contract, which is due the following day. | No issues to report.
| Week 8 Status Report | Take sponsor feedback and apply it to our MVP | Our team had a very insightful meeting with the project sponsors where we got more specifications about the purpose, workflow, and target audience of our project. | No issues for now, our previous issue about the canceled iCubed meeting was resolved by creating a Google Form to electronically receive feedback on MVP.

## Spring Semester

| Document | Tasks | Accomplishments| Issues |
|---|---|---|---|
| Week 1 Status Report | Meet with other senior project members from the other School of Nursing projects to figure out how they are going to implement backend stuff. | Had our first meeting back as a team to reiterate our upcoming milestones and talked a little bit mroe about how we are going to implement the backend. | No issues for now. |
| Week 2 Status Report | Find some time to meet with Dr. Leonard to gain some more insight on what we should do with our new info regarding the backend. | We met with some other student researchers and learned how they went about designing and implementing the backend into their projects: One of the students has developed a specific API just for this project and has allowed us to have access to it | No issues for now. |
| Week 3 Status Report | Continue work on Figma prototype, start to develop a 'Results' page that will dish out information for researchers based on the selected filters. | Alex has come up with a continuation of our Figma prototype page, and has added a filter page to the original layout. We are thinking of scrapping the idea of a keyword search bar in favor of a more streamlined filter system, since that works out of the box with the new API. | One of the group members of another team has created dynamic graphs based on the data from the API database, and we have no idea how they implemented it. We want to have something similar, so we're asking them for help in that regard. |
| Week 4 Status Report | Have another meeting sometime with our project sponsors, as we have not had a meeting with them for a while, and see if they ever received the feedback form we sent out to them before the end of last semester. | Our meeting this week consisted of learning more about the API system and the calls it makes, learning that we do not have to develop anything in a specific language or framework, the API is really independent. | No issues for now. |
