| Document | Tasks | Accomplishments | Issues |
|---|---|---|---|
| Week 1 Status Report | Introductions, setting up Discord server | We met as a team for the first time and introduced ourselves as students: What major we are, and what year we are in. Haley set up a Discord server for us to ahve an open communication line and to share any resources we need easily. | No problems to report! |
| Week 2 Status Report | Have our first meeting with our faculty sponsor, Dr. John Leonard | We as a team gained valuable information regarding the direction of our focus after the meeting with Dr. Leonard. The GitHub was also cleaned up a little bit, and the README was updated to be in-lin with our next deliverable requirements. | No issues to report, smooth sailing for now. |
| Week 3 Status Report | Have a meeting with our sponsor, Dr. Lana Sargent, submit next project deliverable | Status reports were created in the project's GitHub, and the GitHub repo setup assignment was turned in successfully. | No issues to report! |
| Week 4 Status Report | Start work on the Project Proposal ASAP. | Met with Dr. Leonard and received some helpful information regarding some example databases we can show off to project sponsors for feedback. Met with the sponsors who informed us to become familiar with REDCAP, the database we will be using for the actual medical data. | Prepared a timeline of events in relation to due dates / project proposal. | No issues to report.
| Week 5 Status Report | Continue work on the Project Proposal and have another meeting with sponsors soon | Met together as a team to talk more about how we want to tackle the Project Proposal, as the deadline is rapidly approaching. Start prototyping with Figma to make a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) to use in future presentations. | No major accomplishments this week, continueing piecework on Project Proposal | No issues to report.
| Week 6 Status Report | This week's focus was to get more questions prepared for our Database Compilation document we will eventually be sending to sponsors | Have another meeting with sponsors to get clarification on data elements and initial learning on REDCap database with other Capstone teams. | After having another meeting with Dr. Leonard who told us to gather examples of other databases to show to sponsors, we created a Database Compilation document that showcases various examples of landing pages. | Our initial meeting with iCubed researchers on Nov. 19th was canceled, so we will have to find another way to present our research outside of a meeting with them.
| Week 7 Status Report | Week focus: Submit the Project Proposal | Submit Team Contract through Canvas by end of the week and start focusing more on the Figma prototype. | Had our weekly team meeting where we all came together to work on the first threee sections of the Team Contract, which is due the following day. | No issues to report.
| Week 8 Status Report | Continue work on Figma prototype. | Take sponsor feedback and apply it to our MVP | Our team had a very insightful meeting with the project sponsors where we got more specifications about the purpose, workflow, and target audience of our project. | No issues for now, our previous issue about the canceled iCubed meeting was resolved by creating a Google Form to electronically receive feedback on MVP.
